# Fate of Delve

Fate of Delve is a modern-traditional roguelike/town management game. After receiving a letter from your father about the pending doom of a dungeon town Delve, you travel there only to find it has already been destroyed. With no sign of your father or the maddness he claimed had spread over the dungeon, you set forth; gathering resources and begin rebuilding the town of Delve. But not everything is as it seems, and soon you learn that your father's letter was not a cry for help, but a warning. Can you solve the mystery of the mad dungeon and save Delve? Or will history repeat itself?

## Planned Features

- A dungeon town you can upgrade as you play (I want to mostly complete the core dungeon mechanics first)
- Day/night cycles and seasons that affect your town and the dungeon (as well as what supplies you need. i.e you might need more water in the summer, and warm clothes in the winter)
- A simple (kinda optional) survival system that modifies your stats based on your condition, but you wont starve or freeze to death, don't worry.
- Town defense events.
- Quest/lore NPCs with optional ChatGPT dialogue (because I'm a sucker for AI-generated dialogue in games, but it wont make a difference on gameplay aside from RP)
- A dunegon that goes through waves of being really easy with sparse loot, and really difficult with abundant loot.
- A crazed dungeon with multiple-personalty-disorder that will stoke the embers of chaos repeatedly.
- An item system that uses material tiers and modifiers instead of simple variants. (So items can be more easily randomized and potentially upgraded)
- Co-op multiplayer support (maybe also a PVP gamemode).
